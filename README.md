# About Me

## Arash Mahjoob

### Introduction

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arash Mahjoob, a computer engineer turned financial manager with a passion for programming and data science. Over the past 14 years, I've honed my skills in financial management while also delving into the world of programming, particularly focusing on Python.

### Background

I began my journey in computer engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and system design. However, my curiosity and interest in finance led me to transition into the financial sector, where I've spent the last decade and a half working as a financial manager. During this time, I've gained valuable experience in financial analysis, risk management, and strategic planning.

### Journey into Data Science

Despite my success in financial management, my passion for programming never waned. I've always been fascinated by the power of data and its ability to drive insights and decision-making. This led me to embark on a new adventure as a data scientist and analyzer.

### Why Python?

Python has been my language of choice for several reasons. Its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries make it ideal for various applications, including data science. I've found Python to be incredibly versatile, whether I'm cleaning and analyzing data with pandas, performing numerical computations with NumPy, or building machine learning models with scikit-learn.

### Current Focus

Currently, I'm diving deeper into Python as a data scientist and analyzer. I'm exploring advanced topics such as machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning to extract meaningful insights from data and solve complex problems.

### Get in Touch

I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts, whether it's to collaborate on projects, share insights, or simply geek out over programming and data science.
